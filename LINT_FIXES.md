# Lint Fixes

## Summary of Changes

This document summarizes the changes made to fix lint errors in the JumpCloud provider.

### 1. Fixed `errcheck` Errors

The most common error was not checking the return value of `d.Set()` calls. We fixed this by:

- Adding error checking to all `d.Set()` calls in `resource_user.go`
- Returning appropriate diagnostic errors when `d.Set()` fails

Example:
```go
// Before
d.Set("field_name", value)

// After
if err := d.Set("field_name", value); err != nil {
    return diag.FromErr(fmt.Errorf("error setting field_name: %v", err))
}
```

### 2. Improved Makefile Commands

We enhanced the Makefile with better lint commands:

- Updated `lint` command to use the same configuration as GitHub Actions
- Added `lint-strict` command that fails on lint errors
- Added `pr-checks` command that runs all PR checks with strict linting
- Fixed compatibility issues with different versions of `golangci-lint`
- Updated `.golangci.yml` to be compatible with golangci-lint v2.x

### 3. Fixed `tfproviderlint` Script

We improved the `check_critical_lint.sh` script to:

- Find `tfproviderlint` in various locations (PATH, GOPATH, HOME/go/bin)
- Provide better error messages when the tool is not found
- Use the correct path to the tool

### 4. Updated Makefile Help

We updated the help section in the Makefile to include the new commands:

- `make lint` - Run linters (ignoring errors)
- `make lint-strict` - Run linters (failing on errors)
- `make pr-check` - Run all PR checks locally (ignoring lint errors)
- `make pr-checks` - Run all PR checks locally (failing on lint errors)

## Next Steps

To continue improving the code quality, we should:

1. Fix the remaining lint errors in other files
2. Address the unused functions in test files
3. Implement proper error checking for all API calls
4. Update the documentation to reflect the new lint requirements

## Running Lint Checks

To run the lint checks locally:

```bash
# Run linters (ignoring errors)
make lint

# Run linters (failing on errors)
make lint-strict

# Run all PR checks (ignoring lint errors)
make pr-check

# Run all PR checks (failing on lint errors)
make pr-checks
```
