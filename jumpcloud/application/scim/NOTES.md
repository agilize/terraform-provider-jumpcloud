# SCIM Refactoring Notes

## Completed Refactoring

### Resources
- `jumpcloud_scim_server` ✅
- `jumpcloud_scim_attribute_mapping` ✅
- `jumpcloud_scim_integration` ✅

### Data Sources
- `jumpcloud_scim_servers` ✅
- `jumpcloud_scim_schema` ✅

## Improvements Made
1. **Standardized Naming**: All SCIM-related resources and data sources now follow consistent naming patterns.
2. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Improved error messages with more context for better debugging.
3. **Code Organization**: Moved all SCIM-related code to its own domain package for better maintainability.
4. **Test Coverage**: Added comprehensive tests for all resources and data sources.
5. **Documentation**: Improved code comments and added README.md for the SCIM package.

## Next Steps
- Ensure all tests pass with the refactored code
- Consider adding more validation for inputs (e.g., validate SCIM schema URI format)
- Implement additional helper functions for common SCIM operations across resources
- Add more comprehensive examples in the documentation
